## Urdu News Ticker Text Recognition in Video
Cursive text detection and recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision.Urdu text is cursive in nature which is mainly written in Nastaleeq script; a script that was developed in the Persian region in the 14th and 15th century. It has 37 alphabets and the language is highly context sensitive. Urdu alphabets join together to form ligatures. A ligature is a combination of two or more alphabets joined to form a unique shape. In total Urdu language has well over 26,000 ligatures.
  ### Key Challenges: 
  1.Character Segmentation
  2.Ligature Coverage
  3.Static and scrolling ticker-text
  ***Text understanding systems include three main topics:
  A.Text Detection
  B.Text Extraction 
  C.Text Recognition
  
  In first phase we are focusing on a deep learning-based text detector called EAST, which is based on Zhou et al.’s 2017 paper, EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector.
